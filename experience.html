I held office hours, graded coursework, and facilitated course discussion for over 80 undergraduate and graduate students. This course is part of the core curriculum in the Biomedical Informatics program at Stanford University.

                            I co-founded World In-Sight, a multicultural fair similar to World Expo bringing together culture groups on campus to showcase their culture to the UCLA community, which attracted over 1000 participants. I directed the collaboration of 28 different cultural UCLA student organizations by holding weekly meetings, establishing a centralized mode of communication, maintaining routine contact with representatives. The group fundraised $12000 by applying to student funding and outreaching to external sponsors.
